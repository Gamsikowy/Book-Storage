## Goal of the project:
It is an application that aims to create an online library. To add a copy, provide the relevant information describing the book, rate it and add a photo of its cover. An additional variety is the automatic search for the cover using the puppeteer.js library.<br>When displaying a set of books, you can sort the items and, thanks to the viewer from the Googe Books API, read the book.
